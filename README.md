An extension for Chrome that converts KG to pounds
This project was born of my frustration with browsing a fitness forum which had a sizeable population of people that use the 
metric system.
Naturally, I decided that it would be easier to write a Chrome extension than to actually do the mental math every time I saw 
units measured in KG.

This is about the final version, and the only thing I'm still working on is having the hotkey set by default, rather than by 
the user.
